    "* _**Interpreted Language**:_\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Python is an interpreted language, which means that when you write Python code, it doesn't get translated into a language that a computer can directly understand. Instead, the Python code is interpreted, or executed, line by line by a program called the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For Example, you're in a foreign country where you don't speak the language. You have a translator with you who can interpret what people are saying and tell you what they mean in a language you do understand. Similarly, the Python interpreter is like a translator that takes your Python code and interprets it, or translates it, into instructions that the computer can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _**High-Level Language**_\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * A high-level language is a programming language that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It is in contrast to low-level languages, which are designed to be easy for computers to understand.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * High-level languages are typically written in a way that is similar to human language. This makes them easier for humans to understand and read. For example, high-level languages typically use words and symbols that are familiar to humans, such as \"if,\" \"while,\" and \"for.\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Low-level languages, on the other hand, are written in a way that is very different from human language. They use symbols and codes that are designed to be easy for computers to understand. For example, a low-level language might use the symbol \"01010101\" to represent the number 1.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **_General-Purpose Language_**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A general-purpose language is a programming language that can be used for a variety of tasks. This is in contrast to a specialized language, which is designed for a specific task, such as web development or data science. Python is a general-purpose language. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including:\n",
